# On using GitHub
NOTE: This 'page' has to be enabled in the repository settings with the branch assigned. After that I'm guessing the either the copied branch from the root 'Skills/github-pages' has Jekyll set as the default "webpage" designer.
I dont find this completely inituitive. Perhaps, I need to read more about repositories and CI/CD.
Also, not really sure what the point of a blog is if you can just create an '.md' file for communicating items.
